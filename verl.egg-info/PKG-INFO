           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LLM360/Reasoning360.git
cd Reasoning360
```


```bash
conda create -n Reasoning360 python=3.12
conda activate Reasoning360
conda install -c nvidia/label/cuda-12.4.0 cuda-toolkit cuda-nvcc
pip install uv # using uv to install packages is faster than pip
uv pip install torch==2.6.0
uv pip install flash-attn==2.7.3 --no-build-isolation
uv pip install -e .[gpu,math,vllm,test]
```

Alternatively, you can refer to verl [installment guidance](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for setup.


---
## Data preparation
The full ready-to-train 92K Guru RL data is already released under [LLM360 huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLM360/guru_RL)!  If you would like to build (or experience) the data pipeline from scratch, we also provide detailed guidances for [data preparation](./data_preprocess/README.md) and [filtering by data difficulty levels](./model_filtering/README.md).

Quick data check:
```python
import json
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load dataset
train_data = load_dataset("LLM360/guru-RL-92k", split="train", streaming=True)

print(f"Columns: {train_data.column_names}")
print(f"First item: {next(iter(train_data))}")
```

---
## RL Training
### (1) Download data
Download the data and prepare them into `.parquet`, the expected default format in training script. We provide a simple script to download and organize Guru data `scripts/tools/download_guru.py`, with all dataset files for training, online & offline evaluation to local directories.
By defauly, training files will be put in `./data/train`. Online evaluation files will be put in `./data/online_eval`. Offline evaluation files will be put in `./data/offline_eval`.

### (2) [Optional] Customize chat template
Run `tools/change_tokenizer_config.py` if you want to apply 'think'-aware chat template. Now only the 'Qwen' families are supported.
```python
python tools/change_tokenizer_config.py -i <input_model_directory> -o <output_model_directory>
```

### (3) [Optional] SandboxFusion Code Execution

SandboxFusion provides secure code execution for training and evaluation. It supports both containerized SLURM deployment and local installation.

#### Quick Setup

**Option 1: SLURM Container (Recommended for production)**
```bash
# Download container
enroot import docker://varad0309/code_sandbox:server

# Deploy with SLURM
sbatch scripts/sandbox/run_server.sbatch
```

**Option 2: Local Installation (Development only)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/SandboxFusion.git
cd SandboxFusion
poetry install
make run-online
```

#### Configuration

Configure sandbox servers in your training script:

```bash
# Single server
export SANDBOX_FUSION_SERVERS="fs-mbz-gpu-044"

# Multiple servers (load balancing)
export SANDBOX_FUSION_SERVERS="fs-mbz-gpu-044,fs-mbz-gpu-045"
```

Or programmatically:
```python
from verl.utils.reward_score.coder1.sandboxfusion_exec import code_exec_sandboxfusion

# Single server
success, output = code_exec_sandboxfusion(
    code="print('Hello')", 
    sandbox_servers="fs-mbz-gpu-044"
)

# Multiple servers
success, output = code_exec_sandboxfusion(
    code="print('Hello')", 
    sandbox_servers=["fs-mbz-gpu-044", "fs-mbz-gpu-045"]
)
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [`verl/utils/reward_score/coder1/README.md`](verl/utils/reward_score/coder1/README.md).


### (4) Train
We provide the multi-node training slurm script using a `math3k` subset data for ablation, not the full data. Change the `SHARED_DATA_PATH` upon your data path.
```bash
sbatch scripts/train/example_multinode_rl_qwen32b_base.sh
```

If you need to train on the full data or include STEM data in Guru, host the llm-as-verifier model first before launching the training.
```bash
sbatch scripts/tools/serve_llm_as_verifier.sh
```
Then fill in the `export STEM_LLM_JUDGE_URL="<STEM_LLM_JUDGE_URL>"` by the llm-as-verifier server IP. It uses one GPU node to serve a 1.5B [general-verifier](https://huggingface.co/TIGER-Lab/general-verifier) now.

(TODO: build a single-node script not using slurm)


---
## Evaluation
We provide a evaluation suite of of 17 tasks supporting multi-node inference based on [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl). For quick start, run
```bash
sbatch scripts/offline_eval/example_multinode_eval_guru7b.sh
```
Please refer to `scripts/offline_eval/README.md` if you would like to know and customize evaluation details.

## Contributing
### Add a new dataset for training (or evaluation)

**Step1: Data preprocessing script**

In preprocessing, we will process the data into a list of dictionaries, and then save it into a parquet file.

1. Prompt preprocessing

    We need to process the raw question into a prompt ready to be fed to the LLM. An example is [[1](data_preprocess/math/dapo_or1_merge_deduped.py)].

    Each data point is processed into a dict, and we need to specify the prompt within the data dict:
    ```
    "prompt": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": prompt
    }],
    ```

    Note that, when we use verl to train the model, it will turn into a prompt string with `apply_chat_template`.

    Note that:
    - You will probably need to add some task-specific instruction in the `question`. E.g., for math, we concatenate the raw problem with `Please output the final answer within \\boxed{}.`, so that it's easy to extract the answer from model output.
    - You don't need to instruct the model to "think step by step" or "wrap your thinking process in `<think>` `<\think>`". This should be taken care by verl during training with `apply_chat_template`. To enable this, we have a [script](scripts/tools/change_tokenizer_config.py) to modify the chat template of a huggingface model (currently only tested on Qwen).
    - Please add an instruction under the README of `data_preprocess`

2. Reward function

    We need to specify the information regarding reward calculation for the new dataset.

    This typically includes three keys in the dict: `data_source`, `reward_model["ground_truth"]`, `extra_info`.

    In our training, we use [`default_compute_score`](verl/utils/reward_score/__init__.py#L17), which routes the reward computing to a specific reward function implementation based on `data_source`. `ground_truth` and `extra_info` will be passed as arguments.

**Step2: Reward function**

Please look at [`default_compute_score`](verl/utils/reward_score/__init__.py#L17). You can write your own reward function for the task, and import it here. It's highly recommended to add a timeout module to avoid the training being stuck by a corner case of reward function ([example](verl/utils/reward_score/zebra_puzzle.py)).

**Step3: Training script**

Verify the inclusion of a new dataset by actually training models with it. Please refer the template script in this repo.
